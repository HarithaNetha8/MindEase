## 🧭 Run locally (Windows - PowerShell)

Start the backend (Flask + transformers). From repository root:

```powershell
cd .\backend
python -m venv .venv; .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

Start the frontend (Vite):

```powershell
cd .\frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

By default the frontend runs on http://localhost:5173 and the backend on http://127.0.0.1:5000. 
The Chatbot component calls `/api/analyze` on the backend.
